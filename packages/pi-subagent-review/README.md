# @howaboua/pi-subagent-review

Adds `/review`, which sends the current repository state to an isolated review subagent and injects its findings back into the main session for triage.

## Install

Requires Pi 0.87.0 or newer.

```bash
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-subagent-review
```

Run `/reload` after installation if Pi is already open.

## Usage

```text
/review
/review focus on migrations and tests
/review loop
/review stack=main@origin
/review stack="description(exact:'release base')" focus on migrations
```

Anything after `/review` becomes additional reviewer guidance. A leading `loop` starts review-loop mode and is removed from that guidance. In a JJ workspace, `stack=<ancestor revset>` selects a cumulative review base and is removed from that guidance; quote a revset containing spaces. Only one `stack=` argument is accepted.

Findings are advisory. The command tells the main agent to verify and categorize them against the current implementation and session context, then get your disposition before making changes.

`/review` waits for current agent work to finish, runs the reviewer, then sends its findings back to the main agent.

With a compatible optional Pi Codex Responses adapter, the review preface uses developer-role policy. Raw findings and triage instructions remain lower-authority messages. Idle delivery starts a normal user-message turn.

## Review scope

In a JJ workspace, the extension reviews the active revision before considering an enclosing Git checkout. It pins the active change and commit IDs, reviews against its direct parent by default, and uses `stack=<ancestor revset>` for a cumulative range. The active revision must be conflict-free. The read-only command reviews stored commit content; capture filesystem edits with JJ before invoking `/review`.

Elsewhere, the extension chooses among local `dev`, `main`, and `master` branches, then reviews from the merge base so committed and dirty changes are included without base-only commits. With no usable base it reviews the checkout; with no changes it reviews the latest commit.

When enabled, a separate model summarizes the current Pi branch for the reviewer; raw turns are not sent. Review continues diff-only if summarization fails.

## Review loops

`/review loop` records a review-specific marker. The next `/review` summarizes fixes since that point with the configured `summary` model, advances the marker, and starts another pass. It does not conflict with `pi-auto-trees`' `/marker`.

## Configuration

On first load, the extension creates `~/.pi/agent/pi-subagent-review.json`, or the equivalent path under `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`.

```json
{
  "model": "openai-codex/gpt-6-sol",
  "thinking": "medium",
  "summary": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "openai-codex/gpt-6-luna",
    "thinking": "low"
  }
}
```

Models use Pi's `provider/model` format. Thinking levels through `max` are accepted and clamped. If a configured model is unavailable, the command falls back to the current session model.

The `summary` model prepares both reviewer conversation context and review-loop increment summaries.

Do not load another extension that registers `/review` unless the command collision is intentional.
