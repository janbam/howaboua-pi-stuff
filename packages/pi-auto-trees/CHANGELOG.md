# @howaboua/pi-auto-trees

## 0.1.15

- Keep custom messages out of the editor when returning to their markers with `/end`. Preserve the marked context by navigating to its existing checkpoint rather than reopening the message for editing.

## 0.1.14

- Tree navigation and `/end` now carry conversation summaries through the active notes backend.

  - The agent turn ends after the requested note write, without a follow-up reply.
  - Arriving agents receive a branch summary directing them to read the note before resuming.
  - Default `/end` guidance is task-neutral.
