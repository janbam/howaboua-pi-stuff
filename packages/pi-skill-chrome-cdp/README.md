# @howaboua/pi-skill-chrome-cdp

Controls a local Chrome-family browser through the Chrome DevTools Protocol. It can inspect rendered pages and authenticated tabs, navigate, click, type, evaluate JavaScript, and capture screenshots.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-skill-chrome-cdp
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- Chrome, Chromium, Brave, Edge, or Vivaldi with remote debugging enabled at `chrome://inspect/#remote-debugging`

The bundled CLI is `scripts/cdp.mjs`. It discovers Chrome on `CDP_PORT` or port `9222`, then falls back to `DevToolsActivePort`; set `CDP_PORT_FILE` for a non-standard port-file location.

Use the skill when an agent needs a real rendered page or existing browser state. It includes bounded accessibility snapshots with reusable element IDs, targeted page search, HTML, navigation, network timing, clicks, typing, screenshots, raw CDP calls, and clearer timeout recovery.

Based on [`pasky/chrome-cdp-skill`](https://github.com/pasky/chrome-cdp-skill), with Pi packaging and local changes.
