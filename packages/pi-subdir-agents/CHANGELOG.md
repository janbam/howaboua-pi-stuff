## 0.0.6

- Fixed duplicate AGENTS.md load notifications when the context already appears as an expandable message.

## 0.0.5

- Directory listings load AGENTS.md guidance only for the queried scope, without preloading rules from every child they name. Explicit child access and content-search matches still load the relevant nested guidance.

  Fixed Windows drive-letter paths in content-search matches so they load nested guidance.

## 0.0.4

- Fixed repeated AGENTS.md context injection during repository discovery. Unchanged guidance stays deduplicated; new and edited files still load.

## 0.0.3

- Fixed developer-role AGENTS.md context always displaying in full. Messages now show file paths and expand with Ctrl+O.

## 0.0.2

- Deliver nested AGENTS.md guidance as developer messages when Pi Codex is active, retaining standalone tool-result delivery and branch-aware deduplication.

## 0.0.1
