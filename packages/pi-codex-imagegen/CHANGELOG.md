# @howaboua/pi-codex-imagegen

## 0.0.4

- Image generation and editing now request gpt-image-2.5. Proxy model mappings must use gpt-image-2.5 as their canonical key.

## 0.0.3

- Fixed Codex web search and image generation to use local Codex authentication on unrelated chat providers while preserving explicit Codex routes and optional Pi Codex integration. Removed Pi Codex package dependencies.

## 0.0.2

- Fix worker settlement, custom model preservation, and prompt-only image generation.

  - Settle Shepherdr workers after Pi expands skill or prompt-template invocations.
  - Preserve custom Codex models and `models.json` overrides, including after refresh.
  - Keep optional tool arguments optional in Codex Responses requests while preserving explicit strict sampling.
  - Treat null image selectors as absent, so prompt-only requests generate rather than edit.
  - Honor the details toggle in Notebook Mode to hide duplicate output previews.
  - Show submitted messages without waiting for cached WebSocket warmup, while keeping generation serialized behind it.

## 0.0.1

- Initial release of Imagegen for Codex image generation and editing in normal Pi, Code Mode, and Notebook Mode.

  - Generate new images or edit recent and workspace-local PNG, JPEG, GIF, or WebP files.
  - Save outputs beneath the workspace and use stock, renamed, or proxied Codex providers.
