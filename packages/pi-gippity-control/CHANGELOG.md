# @howaboua/pi-gippity-control

## 0.0.19

- Fixed context continuity, voice replies, and patch preservation.

  - V2 compaction preserves the preceding request's reasoning configuration, then starts a fresh baseline without stale overrides. Astra's temporary effort survives continued work across context windows.
  - Worker updates now accept up to 8 KiB without truncation announcements or offers to read the rest.
  - Reasoning-summary forwarding now recognizes GPT-6 models.
  - Replies resume in voice after a context-window rollover, and carried transcripts no longer falsely report that the user ended the call.
  - Reconnecting voice no longer reposts a cached Voice Context summary.
  - Added an opt-in plain command output toggle for Code and Notebook modes under `/codex Tools`, keeping command metadata while printing output without JSON escaping.
  - Notebook cell results report heap and RSS figures only under memory pressure; routine figures remain available through notebook status.
  - Code and Notebook modes show running-command continuation instructions once per response, preserving the distinction between shell sessions and exec cells.
  - Notebook syntax errors now point to the original cell source, with generated-code diagnostics labeled separately.
  - `apply_patch` now preserves existing line endings, unchanged context text, and trailing blank lines, and supports same-drive relative Windows paths.
  - `apply_patch` rejects repeated source-file sections before writing; multiple hunks in one update remain supported.

## 0.0.18

- Streamed realtime replies now return their final text to the requesting delegation instead of leaving the entire answer in general session context.

## 0.0.17

- Fixed waiting indicators for extension UI prompts.

- Voice summarisation now runs whenever Pi compacts, then starts a fresh realtime session.
