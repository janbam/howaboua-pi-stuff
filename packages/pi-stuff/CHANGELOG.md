# @howaboua/pi-stuff

## 0.0.81

- Include bundled package updates:

  - @howaboua/pi-better-skills-tool: The skills tool now reads mixed skills and unique cross-skill references in one call. Ambiguous reference names report their qualified choices.
  - @howaboua/pi-gippity-control: Fixed context continuity, voice replies, and patch preservation. - V2 compaction preserves the preceding request's reasoning configuration, then starts a fresh baseline without stale overrides. Astra's temporary effort survives continued work across context windows. - Worker updates now accept up to 8 KiB without truncation announcements or offers to read the rest. - Reasoning-summary forwarding now recognizes GPT-6 models. - Replies resume in voice after a context-window rollover, and carried transcripts no longer falsely report that the user ended the call. - Reconnecting voice no longer reposts a cached Voice Context summary. - Added an opt-in plain command output toggle for Code and Notebook modes under `/codex Tools`, keeping command metadata while printing output without JSON escaping. - Notebook cell results report heap and RSS figures only under memory pressure; routine figures remain available through notebook status. - Code and Notebook modes show running-command continuation instructions once per response, preserving the distinction between shell sessions and exec cells. - Notebook syntax errors now point to the original cell source, with generated-code diagnostics labeled separately. - `apply_patch` now preserves existing line endings, unchanged context text, and trailing blank lines, and supports same-drive relative Windows paths. - `apply_patch` rejects repeated source-file sections before writing; multiple hunks in one update remain supported.

  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Shepherdr now adds exact-target recovery guidance to agent-not-found errors without changing accepted agent names or pane IDs.

## 0.0.80

- Include bundled package updates:

  - @howaboua/pi-ask: Removed redundant tool guidance from Ask, Shepherdr, Skills and Browser. Code and Notebook Mode now show one callable contract per tool, with detailed Browser and agent rules in help.
  - @howaboua/pi-better-skills-tool: Removed redundant tool guidance from Ask, Shepherdr, Skills and Browser. Code and Notebook Mode now show one callable contract per tool, with detailed Browser and agent rules in help.
  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Removed redundant tool guidance from Ask, Shepherdr, Skills and Browser. Code and Notebook Mode now show one callable contract per tool, with detailed Browser and agent rules in help.
  - @howaboua/pi-skill-code: Scratchpad guidance now keeps one-off checks temporary and deletes their artifacts after use. Persistent projects require an explicit request to retain them.
  - @howaboua/pi-skill-harness-and-agent-engineering: Agent tool design now rejects bloated contracts across the assembled prompt, including inherited text and duplicated metadata.

## 0.0.79

- Include bundled package updates:

  - @howaboua/pi-auto-trees: Keep custom messages out of the editor when returning to their markers with `/end`. Preserve the marked context by navigating to its existing checkpoint rather than reopening the message for editing.
  - @howaboua/pi-gippity-control: Streamed realtime replies now return their final text to the requesting delegation instead of leaving the entire answer in general session context.
  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Deliver peer messages directly to Pi without submitting unsent human drafts. - Preserve slash-command arguments and use the target session's skill and prompt-template expansion. - Return submission-only acknowledgements for registered extension commands instead of waiting for an assistant reply. Requires Pi 0.84.4 or newer. Update and reload Shepherdr on both controllers and workers, and Pi Codex Conversion where installed.
  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Fixed idle agent reports and manual checkpoint requests to preserve prompt preparation, coalesce concurrent continuations, and process reports arriving during turn settlement. - Manual Compact reuses notes saved in the last completed turn for Local, Tree, and Remote notes-only windows, avoiding a redundant checkpoint turn. Explicit compaction instructions still request a checkpoint. - Compact tool output now offers Off, On, and Minimal. Minimal keeps nested tool results and an expand hint while hiding the trailing Code / Notebook text preview until expanded. Existing Off and On settings keep their behavior. - Shepherdr help makes local routing explicit: agent calls default to the host running Pi, while unfiltered discovery searches all machines. Remote calls use profile IDs, not machine labels or hostnames. - Fixed Shepherdr startup after a Herdr executable replacement leaves a stale ` (deleted)` path. Recovery silently uses the replacement at the same location. Command failures remain visible and no longer imply that Herdr is outdated.

## 0.0.78

- Include bundled package updates:

  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Shepherdr now reads existing Herdr machine profiles and requires Herdr 0.9 or newer. Manage profiles in Herdr; `shepherdr.json`, old machine aliases and their saved watches are no longer used. - Agent prompts and reports identify their source workspace, tab and pane, including current names. - Attributed messages to running Pi Codex agents use developer steering. Idle tasks retain normal user kickoff and extension preparation. - `send` delivers peer messages without blocking or subscribing; use `assign` to delegate work to an existing agent. - Automatic task watches end on completion or failure. Only explicit `watch` subscriptions persist; legacy watches are cleared with a notice.
  - @howaboua/pi-subagent-review: Restore full extension prompt preparation when continuing into a new context window or starting review triage. - Keep tool instructions current through Pi's normal startup hooks without resetting the Notebook. - Let active context management own review-loop navigation summaries.

## 0.0.77

- Include bundled package updates:

  - @howaboua/pi-ask: Shepherdr now discovers and answers waiting questions invoked inside Code and Notebook Mode.
  - @howaboua/pi-auto-trees: Tree navigation and `/end` now carry conversation summaries through the active notes backend. - The agent turn ends after the requested note write, without a follow-up reply. - Arriving agents receive a branch summary directing them to read the note before resuming. - Default `/end` guidance is task-neutral.
  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Deliver blocked-agent handoffs even when transcripts are unavailable. - Reviewer spawns wait for their result before the controller continues. - Implementation subagents are instructed to work directly rather than delegate implementation again. - Discover and answer Pi Ask questions called inside Code and Notebook Mode. - Retain working local and remote monitoring during connection updates, distinguish incomplete coverage from disconnection, and report recovery. - Worker states now show their last-known status during incomplete monitoring. `/herdr connect` retries without replacing a working remote connection. - Catch worker completions during reconnect setup and cancel obsolete or stopped monitoring connections.
  - @howaboua/pi-dynamic-tools: Remove retired bundled extension.

## 0.0.76

  - @howaboua/pi-better-skills-tool: Keep tool results actionable. - Browser evaluation errors preserve JavaScript exception details instead of a generic “Uncaught”. - Skill path inventories omit installed dependencies; reference reads list only the requested sources instead of repeating the full inventory.
  - @howaboua/pi-gpt-switcher: Add /astra for GPT-6 Astra with low reasoning by default and an optional reasoning override.
  - @howaboua/pi-pet: Expose Pi Pet's extension from the package root so aggregate extension packages can load it.
  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Preserve extension-owned messages while delivering true developer-role policy through compatible Pi Codex Responses adapters. - Add an optional custom-message API that retains caller rendering and restoration fields. - Route Shepherdr's unclaimed worker events and orchestration toggles through it, preserving ordinary Pi delivery when unavailable. - Send review preface/triage policy and realtime voice start/end guidance as developer messages without elevating raw reviewer findings, spoken delegations, or transcript tails. - Keep persisted developer messages in context across model switches, using ordinary Pi conversion on incompatible models.
  - @howaboua/pi-shepherdr: Fix worker settlement, custom model preservation, and prompt-only image generation. - Settle Shepherdr workers after Pi expands skill or prompt-template invocations. - Preserve custom Codex models and `models.json` overrides, including after refresh. - Keep optional tool arguments optional in Codex Responses requests while preserving explicit strict sampling. - Treat null image selectors as absent, so prompt-only requests generate rather than edit. - Honor the details toggle in Notebook Mode to hide duplicate output previews. - Show submitted messages without waiting for cached WebSocket warmup, while keeping generation serialized behind it.
  - @howaboua/pi-subagent-review: Preserve extension-owned messages while delivering true developer-role policy through compatible Pi Codex Responses adapters. - Add an optional custom-message API that retains caller rendering and restoration fields. - Route Shepherdr's unclaimed worker events and orchestration toggles through it, preserving ordinary Pi delivery when unavailable. - Send review preface/triage policy and realtime voice start/end guidance as developer messages without elevating raw reviewer findings, spoken delegations, or transcript tails. - Keep persisted developer messages in context across model switches, using ordinary Pi conversion on incompatible models.
