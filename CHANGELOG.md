# Changelog

## 0.0.1

Initial monorepo release for the Howaboua Pi package collection.

This repository brings the previously separate Pi packages into one Bun workspace while keeping every package separately installable. It also adds aggregate packages for installing everything, extensions only, or skills only:

- `@howaboua/pi-stuff`
- `@howaboua/pi-extensions`
- `@howaboua/pi-skills`

Legacy Pi Codex history remains in its [package changelog](./packages/pi-codex-conversion/CHANGELOG.md).

Going forward, package-level changelogs remain the source of truth for each package, and this top-level changelog summarizes monorepo-wide releases.
