# @howaboua/pi-better-skills-tool

Progressive skill discovery for Pi, Code Mode and Notebook Mode. The `skills` tool lists the active catalog by category, reads one skill, or reads selected references without loading an entire package into context.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-better-skills-tool
```

Requires Pi 0.84.3 or newer. Install `@howaboua/pi-codex-conversion` 3.0.25 or newer too for Code Mode and Notebook Mode. The extension remains a normal Pi tool when Codex conversion is absent.

## Start Pi without native skills

This setup assumes agent sessions start with `--no-skills`. Pi then omits its native skill catalog from the initial prompt, while the `skills` tool owns progressive discovery. Without the flag, the extension still works but treats Pi's already-loaded catalog as authoritative.

Our wrapper adds `--no-skills` to agent sessions and passes every supplied Pi argument through unchanged. Package-management and configuration commands bypass the flag:

```zsh
#!/usr/bin/env zsh
set -euo pipefail

real_pi="$HOME/.cache/.bun/bin/pi"

case "${1-}" in
  install|remove|uninstall|update|list|config|auth)
    exec "$real_pi" "$@"
    ;;
  *)
    exec "$real_pi" --no-skills "$@"
    ;;
esac
```

Put the wrapper earlier on `PATH` than the real Pi executable. Change `real_pi` when Pi was installed somewhere other than Bun's global binary directory. Quoted `"$@"` preserves each argument exactly, including spaces and repeated flags.

## Use

Normal Pi uses one structured `command` parameter. Code Mode and Notebook Mode use the compact string surface:

```js
await tools.skills("list")
await tools.skills("list code session")
await tools.skills("read code-review")
await tools.skills("read codebase-hygiene testing js-ts")
```

Pi's loaded skill catalog is authoritative during normal use. When Pi has no loaded skills, including `--no-skills` sessions, the tool falls back to the standard global `skills/` directory under Pi's agent directory and `$PWD/.pi/skills/`. A same-named session skill overrides the global skill. Skill reads include absolute package paths for later reference, script, or asset access. Reference reads return only the requested Markdown and its source paths, without repeating the package inventory.

Remove or disable any legacy `codex-conversion-custom-tools/skills.toml` after installing this extension. Keeping both definitions gives Code Mode two tools named `skills`, which it rejects.

The Code Mode surface is freeform because its input is already a compact routed command. It does not add a provider grammar. Code Mode's outer `exec` grammar remains the only constrained grammar involved.
