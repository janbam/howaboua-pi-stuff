# @howaboua/pi-ask

Adds one agent-callable `ask` tool for human input. It handles free-text prompts, batched choices, review dispositions, and user-only handoffs without making the agent dump a report into chat first.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-ask
```

Try it for one session:

```bash
pi -e npm:@howaboua/pi-ask
```

When [Pi Codex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@howaboua/pi-codex-conversion) 3.0.25 or newer is installed too, `ask` is available inside Code and Notebook Mode as `await tools.ask({ prompts, delivery?, handoff? })`.

## How it behaves

The agent can present several independently decidable prompts in one tabbed panel. Each prompt supports a short title, supporting evidence, one or more choices, free text, and an optional comment. Review findings become one prompt each, so you can fix, defer, or reject them without translating a wall of prose back into instructions.

Questions wait for your response by default. When the agent can continue useful reversible work, it can use `delivery: "steer"` instead. The tool then returns immediately, keeps the same panel open, and delivers your eventual response as steering at the next safe boundary. An active Pi Codex Responses adapter sends the answer with the developer role; other setups receive an ordinary user steering message. Pending steering questions survive session reloads.

For work only you can complete—sign-in, authorization, hardware access, or another manual step—the agent can open a handoff and wait until you mark it done or unable to complete.

When Pi runs inside Herdr with its Pi integration installed, only a waiting ask marks the pane as blocked. A steering ask remains pending while the agent continues.

`Other/rephrase` is always available. Submit it blank when the prompt needs to be rephrased, split, or followed up instead of answered as written.

## Prompt commands

- `/fold [report]` turns a long report or structured list into one interactive disposition prompt per item.
- `/grill [idea]` investigates an idea, asks successive decisions, and keeps the agreed plan in `docs/`.

Both templates are enabled by default. The extension creates `ask.json` under Pi's agent directory on first load. That is `~/.pi/agent/ask.json` by default. `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` changes the agent directory.

```json
{
  "grill": true,
  "fold": true
}
```

Set either value to `false`, then run `/reload`, to hide that template. The same configuration applies when pi-ask is installed through `@howaboua/pi-extensions` or `@howaboua/pi-stuff`.

## TUI controls

The panel uses Pi's active keybindings. The defaults are:

- `Up` / `Down` — move through choices, free text, and comments
- `Enter` — choose or edit the focused item, or save an edit
- `Left` / `Right` — move between prompts and the review tab
- `Tab` — advance, using `Other/rephrase` when the current prompt is unanswered
- `Esc` — dismiss the panel

Configure the corresponding `tui.select.*`, `tui.editor.cursorLeft`,
`tui.editor.cursorRight`, and `tui.input.*` actions in Pi's
`keybindings.json`.

The tool requires Pi's interactive TUI or RPC UI. It returns dismissal as a distinct result so the agent can stop asking rather than guessing.
